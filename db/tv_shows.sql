The President of the Chamber of Fasci Dino Grandi immediately works with the Duce to have Niccolai freed, who had saved his life on the Carso and who is recognized as a war hero. The captain is released at the behest of Mussolini and, upon returning home, tells Grandi that he was arrested because they wanted to know from him the names of those who were dissatisfied with the Duce in the army. One evening Furio Niccolai, while returning home, was attacked by OVRA agents and thrown into the stairwell, dying instantly. Grandi is worried about the situation and King Vittorio Emanuele III di Savoy suggests him to reunite the Grand Council of Fascism. Grandi takes courage and talks about it with the former President of the Senate Luigi Federzoni, not knowing that he is being monitored by Ruggeri.</p>');

Princess Maria José of Belgium also takes personal initiative and meets Monsignor Montini to look for a way out and to carve out a leading role for her husband Umberto II of Savoy in the peace operation. The Duce, furious at the landing, orders that all the hierarchs hold rallies in their cities to reawaken national pride but Grandi refuses.

The Prince, with the Anglo-Americans advancing, then tries to convince his father to oust Mussolini but the King says his hands are tied fearing that the Duce has convened the Grand Council to change the dynastic line of the Savoy. Italo Niccolai, Furio''s son, is seen in the company of Beatrice Grandi, Dino''s niece. The hierarch forbids his niece from seeing the boy because she has joined the anti-fascists but the young woman is too in love with her and the two continue to see each other in secret. Grandi is approached by Ingrid Eriksson, a Swedish journalist sent by Winston Churchill to test the waters for his possible position as prime minister in Mussolini''s place. Grandi and Ciano then make an agreement: for the post-Mussolini period they will act as prime minister and party secretary. Marcello Petacci finds out about it from a man from Ciano and her sister, now unable to notify the Duce directly, sends the news to Edda through Colonel Eugen Dollmann; shortly afterwards Mussolini''s daughter notices her husband talking to Grandi but he downplays the matter. Grandi approaches Italo, telling him not to associate with his niece anymore but the boy does not seem to fear him and also challenges him on a political level.

Vittorio Ambrosio, Chief of Staff of the Italian Army, reports to the King the harsh discussion that took place between Hitler and Mussolini in Feltre and proposes to stop the Duce but Savoy is not at all convinced and asks Pietro Badoglio for advice who tells him that Mussolini''s successor must be one of his most loyal followers. The King receives the Duce and tells him that he will continue to support him. Ciano meets Mario Josè and suggests her not to attempt any risky moves.
